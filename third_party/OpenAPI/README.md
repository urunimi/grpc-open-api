# third_party/OpenAPI

This directory contains HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate Swagger documentation from a Swagger-compliant API definition in [openapi.swagger.json](./openapi.swagger.json) file. That file is auto-generated by running `make generate` in the root of this repository. The static assets are copied from [this dist folder](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/tree/master/dist) of the OpenAPI-UI project.
